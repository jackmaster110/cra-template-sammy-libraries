# CRA Sammy Libraries

This is a template I threw together to save me a little bit of time when setting up a project. It was probably silly, but I might add to it in the future if I start using more libraries in my projects and want to have a more complex template. Hopefully it can be of use to others as well.

#### Libraries ####
